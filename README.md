# mcl65_vhdl
VHDL copy of https://github.com/MicroCoreLabs/Projects/tree/master/MCL65. It has some differences. 
1. reset is active high.
2. it doesn't have a bidirectional bus.
3. it was modified to work with synchronous RAMs
4. I didn't care timing accuracy.
5. I just did it to use a low luts count processor in small FPGAs
6. I didn't test it enough

I strongly recommend to use the original. It's only a personal project, but I like it.
